	A program that generates feed cards for Claremont HVZ 
	with a feed code and its corresponding feeding URL.

	This is a python2 program. If you get nameerrors it's because
	you're running it as a python3 program. Stop doing that.

	If you don't have it already, you need to install the python
	package manager, pip, in order to install the following dependencies.
	Then just run "pip install pyqrcode" and "pip install XlsxWriter" as
	root in order to install them.

	For pyqrcode: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQRCode
	Necessary to create the neat QR code image.

	For xlsxwriter: http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/contents.html
	This website was a huge source, literally the coolest thing ever.
	Does practically anything you would want to do in an Excel sheet.
